Though the U.S. prides itself on being a leader in the world community ,a recent report shows that it lags far behind other industrialized countries in meeting the needs of its youngest and most vulnerable citizens. The U.S.has a higher infant mortality rate ,a higher proportion of low birthweight babies,a smaller proportion of babies immunized against childhood diseases and a much higher rate of adolescent pregnancies . theses findings , described as a “quiet crisis “ requiring immediate and far-reaching action , appeared in a report prepared by a task force of educators , doctors , politicians and business people . According to the report , a fourth of the nation’s 12 million infants and toddlers live in poverty . as many as half confront risk factors that could harm their ability to develop intellectually , physically and socially . child immunization are too low , more children are born into poverty , more are in substandard care while their parents work and more being raised raised by single parents . when taken together these and other risk factors can lead to educations and health problems that are much harder and more costly to reverse.
The crisis begins in the womb with unplanned parenthood. Women with unplanned pregnancies are less likely to seek pre-natal care . in the U.S. 80% of teenage pregnancies and 56% of all pregnancies are unplanned .The problems continue after birth where unplanned pregnancies and unstable partnerships often go hand in hand . Since 1950, the number of single parent families has nearly tripled . More then 25 percent of all births today are to unmarried mothers . As the number of single parent families grows and more women enter the work force , infants and toddlers are increasingly in the care of people other than their parents . 
Most disturbingly , recent statistics show that American parent are increasingly neglecting or abusing their children , In only four years from 1987-1971 the number of children in foster care increased by over 50 percent. Babies under the age of one are the fastest growing category of children entering foster care . The crisis affects children under the age of three most severely , the report says.yet, it is this period- from infancy through preschool years- that sets the stage fir a child’s future.
