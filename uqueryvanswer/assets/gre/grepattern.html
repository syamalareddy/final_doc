  <p><b>Biochemistry, Cell and Molecular Biology Test:</b> This test consists of 170 multiple-choice questions, which are based on descriptions of laboratory situations, diagrams or experimental results. The content of the test is organized into three major areas: biochemistry, cell biology, and molecular biology and genetics.</p>
  <p><b>Biology Test:</b> This test consists of 194 five-choice questions, based on descriptions of laboratory and field situations, diagrams or experimental results. The content is organised into three areas: cellular and molecular biology, organismal biology and ecology and evolution. Equal weight is given to each of these three areas. In addition to the total score, a subscore in each of these subfield areas is reported.</p>
  <p><b>Chemistry Test:</b> The test consists of 130 multiple-choice questions. A periodic table is printed in the test booklet as well as a table of information presenting various physical constants and a few conversion factors among SI units.</p>
